*Hamster is a unique project that combines clicker mechanics with investment opportunities. The developers presented the user with an exciting game where the main element is to click on the image of a hamster, while earning digital currency. But what makes this app unique?*

*Analysis of the game Hamster At the center of the game mechanics of the Hamster bot is a simple but fascinating idea - a clicker. Users must click on the hamster image to earn coins. The more clicks, the more coins they will receive. This creates a dynamic and exciting gameplay, stimulating participants to be active. However, Hamster's functionality does not end there.*

*Hamster goes beyond a simple clicker by offering users the opportunity to invest the coins they earn. Participants are given the opportunity to become a CEO and begin to upgrade their exchange, which will then generate income for its owner. Users can also invest the earned currency in various assets, such as shares and additional bonuses to boost their exchange, which adds a financial component to the project and makes it more attractive to those interested in investing.*

*An important aspect of Hamster is its educational component. Users not only earn coins by playing the bot, but also explore the world of investing and finance. This educational element makes the project especially attractive to novice investors, helping them learn the basics of finance and investing in a playful way.*

*In the Boost tab, users can receive daily bonuses in the form of free energy replenishment and rockets to increase income from taps.*

> *2.Mine: A page for upgrading your exchange. Here you can purchase various power-ups to generate hourly income. Using in-game currency, you buy additions to the exchange, thereby pumping it up. Each power-up brings a certain number of coins per hour. The more enhancements, the more passive income the participant will receive.*

> *4.Airdrop: This tab will be relevant later. Here you can withdraw your tokens and exchange them for real funds when the Airdrop itself begins. And as indicated in the same tab, this moment will come very soon.*

*Overall, Hamster provides users with a variety of opportunities to earn in-game currency, ranging from tapping the hamster to completing various tasks and inviting friends. This approach creates completely new perspectives for the usual tap game and proves progress in development and superiority over similar projects.*

*Thanks to the functionality of each tab, users can actively develop their exchange and increase their income. The expected release of the Airdrop opens up prospects for exchanging tokens for real funds, which makes the project even more attractive for participants.*

### *Why Hamster is better than Notcoin Hamster offers a number of advantages over the Notcoin application. Let's take a closer look at these features:*

*Firstly, controlling a hamster in Hamster is much more convenient thanks to the gamepad. Users can tap on the screen even with several fingers without worrying about possible application crashes, which makes the gaming process more comfortable compared to Notcoin. Secondly, the presence of an educational component in Hamster allows you not only to delve into the basics of the cryptocurrency exchange, but also to earn passive income at the same time. This functionality is unique to Hamster and has become a significant difference from other projects, including Notcoin. Thirdly, the daily income in Hamster exceeds the profitability of Notcoin several times. Thanks to passive income from upgrading the exchange, the mining speed in Hamster increases noticeably, which makes the gameplay more stimulating and attractive for users. And most importantly, passive income from the Hamster exchange works continuously, without stopping, and does not require time to activate. After purchasing a new power-up, it immediately begins to generate income, without any delays or pauses. This is significantly more convenient compared to tap games, which only earned users 12 hours of earnings and required an additional hour to activate.*

*Hamster offers a number of significant advantages over its competitors, including a convenient gamepad, an educational aspect, and a higher daily income. These factors make Hamster an attractive choice for those who want to not only earn, but also learn on the cryptocurrency exchange.*

### *Where to sell Hamster token The developers are already actively stirring up user interest with news about the imminent listing of Hamster. Therefore, you should study in advance information about the platforms that will issue their token. A little about these exchanges:*

> 1.Gate Exchange: The platform is one of the large and long-lived cryptocurrency exchanges, offering a wide range of services and trading tools.

> 2.EXMO Exchange: One of the key advantages of the platform is the margin trading feature, which allows users to trade with leverage.

> 3.Bingx Exchange: The exchange allows you to trade various cryptocurrencies, including Bitcoin (BTC), Ethereum (ETH), and many others.

> 4.Kucoin Exchange: KuCoin has hundreds of trading pairs, including both major cryptocurrencies and many altcoins.


*The upcoming listing of the Hamster token on exchanges confirms the interest in this project, and the expansion of functionality and planned innovations make it a promising tool for earning money and entertainment in the world of cryptocurrencies.*

*If you liked my episode, I will be glad to receive your star! Iâ€™ll leave the application below as well as the auto-clicker for it!*
